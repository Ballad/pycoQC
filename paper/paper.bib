	abstract = {Nanopore DNA strand sequencing has emerged as a competitive, portable technology. Reads exceeding 150 kilobases have been achieved, as have in-field detection and analysis of clinical pathogens. We summarize key technical features of the Oxford Nanopore MinION, the dominant platform currently available. We then discuss pioneering applications executed by the genomics community.},

	abstract = {A long-held goal in sequencing has been to use a voltage-biased nanoscale pore in a membrane to measure the passage of a linear, single-stranded (ss) DNA or RNA molecule through that pore. With the development of enzyme-based methods that ratchet polynucleotides through the nanopore, nucleobase-by-nucleobase, measurements of changes in the current through the pore can now be decoded into a DNA sequence using an algorithm. In this Historical Perspective, we describe the key steps in nanopore strand-sequencing, from its earliest conceptualization more than 25 years ago to its recent commercialization and application.},

	abstract = {This repository uses a bacterial genome to assess the read accuracy and consensus sequence accuracy for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) basecallers. Albacore v2.1.10, Guppy v0.5.1 and Scrappie raw v1.3.0 (all developed by ONT) were the best performers for read accuracy, and Chiron v0.3 produced the best assemblies. Consensus sequence accuracies reached approximately 99.75\%, revealing that even the best basecallers still have systematic error. Nanopolish, used with its methylation-aware option, was able to raise consensus accuracy to about 99.9\%. Most post-Nanopolish assemblies have similar accuracy, making basecaller choice relatively unimportant if Nanopolish is used.},
