# Summary

Nanopore sequencing of nucleic acids took nearly 30 years to develop and is now firmly established as a reliable alternative to sequencing by synthesis methods [@deamer_three_2016]. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) released the first commercial nanopore sequencing device in 2014 and has continually improved the technology since then [@jain_oxford_2016]. Although the read accuracy is only around 90%, ONT technology can sequence very long molecules and generates data in real time. In addition, RNA can be sequenced directly and modified bases can be detected [@garalde2018highly].

The raw signal acquired by the array of nanopores is stored in hdf5 format, with one file (called fast5) per sequenced molecule. The signal is then converted to a nucleic acid sequence using a basecalling software. There are several alternatives, but the best performers for read accuracy are Albacore and Guppy developed and maintained by ONT [@ryan_wick_comparison_2018]. Both softwares can generate fastq files, fast5 files containing basecalling information and a text summary file. However, ONT does not provide any streamlined quality control software to evaluate in depth the quality of the sequencing run.

Here we present pycoQC, a new tool to generate interactive quality control metrics and plots from basecalled nanopore reads or from the summary file generated by Albacore and Guppy. Although there are other open-source alternatives such as Nanoplot [@de_coster_nanopack:_2018], MinionQC [@lanfear_minionqc:_2018] and toulligQC [@berengere_laffay_post_2018], pycoQC has several unique features:

* Integration with [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) python charting library to create dynamic D3.js data visualizations.
* Extensive python API developed for interactive data exploration in Jupyter Notebook ([example notebook](https://a-slide.github.io/pycoQC/pycoQC_usage.html)).
* Generation of a customizable interactive HTML report through a simple command line interface ([example report](https://a-slide.github.io/pycoQC/pycoQC_Albacore-2.1.10_basecall-1D-DNA.htmll)).
* Multiprocessing Fast5 feature extraction program to generate a summary file directly from Fast5 files if not available.
* Support for data generated by ONT MinION, GridION and PromethION devices basecalled by Albacore 1.3+, Guppy 2.1.3+ or MinKNOW 18.12+.

# Principle and example output

Briefly, pycoQC imports, filters and preprocesses one or several summary files generated with either one of the previously mentioned basecallers or with the companion program `Fast5_to_seq_summary` included with the package. Then, a range of plots and tables can be generated to explore the data. pycoQC plots are interactive, allowing users to display all the reads or only those above the quality threshold, to zoom in and to hide legend labels. Static versions of some of the plots produced by the software is presented in Figure 1 to 4. While the command line interace offers a simple and straightforward experience, the python API for Jupyter notebook gives more flexibility to users who can easily customise and share their analyses.
