# Using pycoQC

## Input files

PycoQC needs a text summary file generated by ONT Albacore or Guppy. For 1D run use the file named *sequencing_summary.txt* available the root of Albacore/Guppy output directory. For 1D2, use the *sequencing_1dsq_summary.txt* file that can be found in the 1dsq_analysis directory. The run type is automatically detected from the file.

PycoQC can read compressed sequencing_summary.txt files (‘gzip’, ‘bz2’, ‘zip’, ‘xz’) and instead of a single file it is also possible to pass a [UNIX style regex](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/glob.html) to match multiple files

Depending on the run type and the version of Albacore used some informations might not be available. In particular calibration reads were not flagged in early versions of Albacore. When the field is available those reads are automatically discarded. Similarly barcodes information are only available in multiplexed runs.

PycoQC requires the following fields in the sequencing.summary file:

* 1D run => read_id, run_id, channel, start_time, sequence_length_template, mean_qscore_template
* 1D2 run => read_id, run_id, channel, start_time, sequence_length_2d, mean_qscore_2d

### Example files

pycoQC repository contains several example sequencing summary files generated with various version of Albacore and Guppy. Each of those files only contains 10,000 reads.

* docs/demo/data/summary/Albacore-1.2.1_basecall-1D-DNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Albacore-1.2.3_basecall-1D-RNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Albacore-1.7.0_basecall-1D-DNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Albacore-2.1.10_basecall-1D-DNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Albacore-2.1.10_basecall-1D-RNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Albacore-2.3.1_basecall-1D-RNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Guppy-2.1.3_basecall-1D-DNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz
* docs/demo/data/summary/Guppy-2.1.3_basecall-1D-RNA_sequencing_summary.txt.gz

On top of these summary files for Guppy the barcode information are now stored in a separate barcoding summary file. There is one example in pycoQC:

## PycoQC user interface

PycoQC was designed to be used either through a python Application programming interface (API) for Jupyter notebook or a command line interface (CLI).

### Jupyter API

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a fantastic tool that can be used in many different ways, in particular to share you analyses in an interactive environment with other people.

One of the specificity of pycoQC is to have a rich python API meant to be used directly inside a Jupyter notebook. The pycoQC API for Jupyter is very flexible and allows you to explore your nanopore data interactively and in more depth than with the command line interface.

An online live version of the usage notebook served by MyBinder is also available to familiarize with the package API: [Live notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/a-slide/pycoQC/master?filepath=docs%2FpycoQC_usage.ipynb)

### Bash CLI

On top of the jupyter interface, pycoQC also comes with a command line interface that can generate a beautiful HTML formatted report containing interactive D3.js plots.
